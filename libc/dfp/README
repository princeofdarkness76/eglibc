The source (.c) files in this directory are modules which are included in both
libdfp and lib.  The header files contain headers which may be contained in
both libc and libdfp but may also define headers for modules only included in
libdfp.

For Soft-DFP the decimal rounding mode is stored in libc TLS and accessed via
a pointer to the TLS using the __decrm_location() function.  The
fe_dec_getround() and fe_dec_setround() functions live in libdfp and utilize
the libc __decrm_location() function for soft-dfp to set/get the rounding
mode.  On Power6[x] they operate directly against the extended FPCSR.
