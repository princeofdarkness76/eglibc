# This file documents the option groups EGLIBC currently supports, in
# a format akin to the Linux Kconfig system's.  The syntax may change
# over time.
#
# An entry of the form:
#
#   config OPTION_GROUP_NAME
#       bool "one-line explanation of what this option group controls"
#       help
#           Multi-line help explaining the option group's meaning in
#           some detail, terminated by indentation level.
#
# defines an option group whose variable is OPTION_GROUP_NAME, with
# meaningful values 'y' (enabled) and 'n' (disabled).  The
# documentation is formatted to be consumed by some sort of
# interactive configuration interface, but EGLIBC doesn't have such an
# interface yet.
# 
# Option group variables get their default values from the file
# 'option-groups.defaults', in the top directory of the EGLIBC source
# tree.  By default, all EGLIBC option groups are enabled --- their
# variables are set to 'y'.
#
# After including 'option-groups.defaults', the EGLIBC make machinery
# includes the file 'option-groups.config' from the top of the build
# tree, if it is present.  Developers can place assignments to option
# group variables in that file to override the defaults.  For example,
# to disable an option group, place a line of the form:
#
#    OPTION_GROUP_NAME = n
#
# in 'option-groups.config' at the top of your build tree.  To
# explicitly enable an option group, you may also write:
#
#    OPTION_GROUP_NAME = y
# 
# although this simply reestablishes the value already set by
# 'option-groups.defaults'.

config OPTION_EGLIBC_CATGETS
   bool "Functions for accessing message catalogs"
   help
       This option group includes functions for accessing message
       catalogs: catopen, catclose, and catgets.

config OPTION_EGLIBC_LOCALES
   bool "Locale definitions"
   help
       This option group includes all locale definitions other than
       that for the "C" locale.  If this option group is omitted, then
       only the "C" locale is supported.

config OPTION_EGLIBC_LIBM
   bool "libm (math library)"
   help
       This option group includes the 'libm' library, containing
       mathematical functions.  If this option group is omitted, then
       an EGLIBC installation does not include shared or unshared versions
       of the math library.

       Note that this does not remove all floating-point related
       functionality from EGLIBC; for example, 'printf' and 'scanf'
       can still print and read floating-point values with this option
       group disabled.

       Note that the ISO Standard C++ library 'libstdc++' depends on
       EGLIBC's math library 'libm'.  If you disable this option
       group, you will not be able to build 'libstdc++' against the
       resulting EGLIBC installation.
